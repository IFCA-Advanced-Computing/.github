Welcome to the GitHub organization of the
[Advanced Computing and e-Science Group](https://advancedcomputing.ifca.es) of the
[Instituto de FÃ­sica de Cantabria](https://ifca.unican.es) at the
[Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es) and the
[University of Cantabria (UC)](https://web.unican.es).

Our group is focused on research in distributed computing systems, platforms
and services (mostly cloud computing and supercomputing) for science and
research, with special focus on data science and big data applications.

We are strong supporters of open science, free software, and FAIR and open
data, participating in relevant initiatives like the [European Open Science
Cloud](https://eosc.eu) through research, development and innovation projects.
